# DynamicObjectDataset
Based on the KITTI raw data, we establish a moving object detection dataset.

This dataset contains 9 typical scene sequences, which mainly concentrate on three categories: car, pedestrian, and cyclist. The groundtruth is created according to the official format of the KITTI Object Detection Task.

The Sequences List:
